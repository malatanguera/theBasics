Mini-projects put together while learning Python

Hello world! 

Never thought I'd actually use that! 

I'm a truly terrible tanguera, I dance in jeans and sneakers, on whatever floor I happen to be standing on, to any music that's playing! That must be why I perform so much and have students seeking me out! 

I'm also ISTQB certified as a pretty decent tester, building up my tech chops to become an automation engineer
